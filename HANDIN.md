## Conflict Resolution

**Files:** README.md
**Members involved:** Lukas & Gretlin (created conflict), Natalia (resolved with Lukas's help)
**Resolution process:** Merged both versions, resolved with `git merge main`, fixed conflict markers, committed.

## Merge Strategies Used

### Regular Merge Commit
- Used for: Gretlin's README improvements, Oliver's Docker docs
- Why: Preserved commit history

### Squash Merge
- Used for: Raivo's CONTRIBUTING.md, Natalia's CONTRIBUTORS.md, Lukas's conflict resolution
- Why: Clean single commits for documentation

### Rebase Merge
- Used for: Lukas's organization switcher
- Why: Linear history without merge commits
